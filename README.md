OA-armsim is a python module to simulate synthetic forearm acoustic pressure maps.   
The code here implements the acoustic map generation for the simulated cylinder dataset (SCD) presented in Lafci, B., Ozdemir, F., Dean-Bean, X.L., Razansky D., and Perez-Cruz, F. (2022). OADAT: Experimental and Synthetic Clinical Optoacoustic Data for Standardized Image Processing. 

## Demo

A demo file showcasing how to generate synthetic acoustic pressure maps and ground truth annotation maps of background, vessels, and skin curve is shown in file [demo.ipynb](notebooks/demo.ipynb)
